# Hydroponic Strawberry Cultivation: A Week-by-Week Growing Schedule (DWC)

## Introduction

The cultivation of strawberries using hydroponic methods presents an innovative and efficient approach to producing this popular fruit. This soilless cultivation technique offers several advantages over traditional farming, including the elimination of soil-borne pests and diseases, and the precise delivery of nutrients directly to the plant roots.[1, 2] Furthermore, hydroponic systems allow for greater control over environmental factors, potentially leading to enhanced yields and the possibility of year-round production.[2, 3, 4, 5] To maximize the benefits of hydroponic strawberry cultivation, a carefully planned and executed growing schedule is essential. This report provides a comprehensive week-by-week guide for cultivating day-neutral strawberries in a hydroponic system, incorporating key parameters such as nutrient levels, lighting, temperature, humidity, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Day-neutral varieties are particularly well-suited for hydroponic environments due to their capacity for continuous fruiting without strict dependence on seasonal changes in daylight hours.[6, 7] Deep Water Culture (DWC) is a suitable hydroponic method for strawberries, where the roots are submerged in an aerated nutrient solution.[2, 8, 9, 10, 11]

## Growth Stages of Hydroponic Strawberries

The lifecycle of a hydroponically grown strawberry plant can be segmented into several distinct phases, each with specific requirements for optimal growth and fruit production.[12, 13, 14, 15] The initial **Seedling/Establishment Phase**, typically lasting for the first two weeks, focuses on the plant's transition into the hydroponic system and the development of its root structure.[6, 8, 16, 17, 18] Starting with established strawberry plugs or runners, rather than seeds, is highly recommended for a quicker and more successful start.[6, 18, 19] During this period, it is crucial to ensure that the crown of the plant remains above the nutrient solution to prevent the occurrence of rot.[6, 7] Following establishment, the plant enters the **Vegetative Growth Phase**, spanning approximately weeks three through six.[6] This stage is characterized by the development of a strong foliage system, with the plant dedicating its energy to producing leaves and roots. It is often beneficial to pinch off any early flower buds that may appear to encourage more robust vegetative growth, which will support higher fruit yields later in the cycle.[6, 20, 21, 22] The appearance of runners, which are horizontal stems used for propagation, may also occur during this phase, and these should generally be removed to keep the plant focused on vegetative growth and subsequent fruiting.[2, 6, 22] The **Flowering Phase** typically occurs around weeks seven through nine, marked by the initiation and development of flower buds.[6, 20, 23] Pollination is a critical process during this stage, as it directly leads to fruit development.[7] In the absence of natural pollinators in a hydroponic setup, manual pollination techniques are necessary.[1, 6, 7, 19, 22, 24] Finally, the **Fruiting Phase** begins around week ten and continues in cycles for day-neutral varieties.[12, 13, 14, 15, 23, 25] After successful pollination, the strawberries will develop, enlarge, and ripen. Regular harvesting of mature berries is important to encourage the plant to continue producing more flowers and fruits.[5, 22, 26] The duration and intensity of the fruiting phase can be influenced by various environmental and nutritional factors.[27, 28]

## Nutrient Management with GH MaxiFlora Series

The General Hydroponics (GH) MaxiFlora series, often understood to include MaxiGro for vegetative growth and MaxiBloom for flowering and fruiting, alongside FloraMicro as a crucial component providing essential micronutrients, forms the nutritional foundation for this schedule.[29, 30, 31] During the initial six weeks, focusing on seedling establishment and vegetative growth, a higher ratio of FloraGro is recommended to encourage robust leaf and stem development, complemented by FloraMicro. FloraBloom should be used in smaller amounts during this stage. Growers should consult the specific GH Flora Series feed charts for precise mixing ratios tailored to their water quality and the specific growth week.[32, 33, 34] It is important to note that the initial nutrient solution should be relatively mild to prevent shocking the young plants.[16] As the plants transition into the flowering phase around week seven, a gradual shift towards a higher ratio of FloraBloom is necessary to support the development of flowers, while still maintaining the use of FloraMicro. The amount of FloraGro should be reduced during this period, following the guidance provided in the GH feed charts. The increased phosphorus content in FloraBloom is vital for flower formation.[5, 7, 35] Once the plants enter the fruiting phase, typically around week ten and continuing for subsequent fruiting cycles, a higher ratio of FloraBloom remains crucial to support the development and ripening of the strawberries, along with FloraMicro. The use of FloraGro should be minimal or discontinued during peak fruiting, depending on the specific recommendations of the GH feed charts. The potassium provided by FloraBloom plays a key role in fruit development and overall quality.[5, 35] Given the propensity of strawberries to develop secondary nutrient deficiencies, particularly in calcium and magnesium, the use of a supplement like GH CalMag is advisable throughout the entire growing cycle, especially when using reverse osmosis (RO) water.[16, 21, 9, 36] To ensure accurate nutrient management, it is essential to regularly monitor the strength of the nutrient solution using an EC meter and adjust the feeding as needed. Electrical conductivity (EC) provides a more direct and reliable measure of the total dissolved salts in the solution compared to parts per million (PPM), which can vary depending on the meter's calibration.[2, 5, 6, 19, 24, 9, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41] For DWC, some growers recommend starting with a slightly lower PPM in the seedling stage.[5, 6, 20, 26, 37, 10, 42, 43, 44, 45]

## Environmental Control

Maintaining the optimal environmental conditions is paramount for successful hydroponic strawberry cultivation. The recommended daytime temperature range is 18-24¬∞C (65-75¬∞F), while nighttime temperatures should be slightly cooler, ideally between 15-18¬∞C (59-64¬∞F).[2, 8, 26, 27, 46, 47, 48, 49] Cooler night temperatures, specifically in the range of 10-12¬∞C (50-54¬∞F), can further enhance the sweetness and overall flavor of the strawberries.[27, 46, 47, 49] Humidity control is equally important. The relative humidity should be maintained within the range of 60-75% [1, 5, 13, 46, 50], as humidity levels above 60% are beneficial for proper calcium absorption.[1, 46] However, excessively high humidity can create an environment conducive to fungal diseases such as Botrytis (grey mold) and powdery mildew.[1, 26] To address the need for sufficient calcium uptake and prevent tip burn, it is recommended to increase the nighttime humidity to around 95% for a period of 2-3 hours, 2-3 nights per week.[27, 51, 52, 53] Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is another critical environmental parameter that reflects the relationship between temperature and humidity, influencing the plant's transpiration rate.[54, 55, 56, 57] Maintaining a VPD range of 0.3-1.2 kPa is generally recommended for strawberries.[49, 56, 58] Lower VPD levels (higher humidity) may be beneficial during the early seedling and flowering stages, while slightly higher VPD can be advantageous during vegetative growth and later fruiting to help manage humidity and reduce the risk of diseases. Growers can calculate VPD using online tools or by employing sensors that measure both temperature and humidity.[57] In addition to temperature and humidity, ensuring adequate ventilation and air circulation within the hydroponic system is crucial for regulating these factors, preventing stagnant air, and minimizing the likelihood of fungal diseases.[1, 2, 5, 24, 9, 59] **For DWC, maintaining the nutrient solution temperature below 24¬∞C (75¬∞F) is important to prevent root rot.**[9]

## Pollination

While strawberries are self-fertile, they often require assistance with pollination in the controlled environment of a hydroponic system to ensure adequate fruit set.[6, 7, 19, 24] Manual pollination is typically necessary, and this can be effectively achieved by using a small, soft brush to gently transfer pollen from the stamens (the male part of the flower) to the pistils (the female part) of each blossom.[6, 7, 19] This process should be performed daily, particularly during the flowering period, to maximize the chances of successful fertilization.[22] The use of a small fan to create a gentle airflow around the plants can also aid in pollen dispersal, mimicking natural wind pollination.[1, 19]

## Common Challenges in DWC

Several challenges can arise during the hydroponic cultivation of strawberries, and **root rot is a significant concern in DWC systems.** Preventative measures include maintaining the nutrient solution temperature within the recommended range (18-24¬∞C or 65-75¬∞F) [6, 8, 9], **ensuring proper oxygenation of the nutrient solution through the use of air stones** [9], and considering the application of root protectants like Hydroguard.[7, 16, 9] Nutrient imbalances can also occur, highlighting the importance of using a balanced nutrient solution specifically formulated for fruiting plants and consistently monitoring and adjusting the EC and pH levels.[2, 5, 19, 22, 26] Although hydroponic systems reduce the risk of soil-borne pests, strawberries can still be susceptible to pests such as aphids and spider mites. Regular inspection of the plants and the use of natural pest control methods, such as introducing beneficial insects or applying neem oil, can help manage these issues.[1, 12, 19] Maintaining good hygiene practices within the growing area, including regularly cleaning the system and removing any dead or diseased plant material, is crucial for preventing the spread of diseases.[2, 4, 17]

## Harvesting and Storage

Harvesting hydroponic strawberries at the optimal time is essential for maximizing their flavor and quality. The berries are typically ready for harvest when they have developed a uniform, bright red color and are slightly soft to the touch.[2, 5, 22, 24, 26] When harvesting, handle the berries with care to avoid bruising, gently twisting or snipping them off the stem.[2, 5, 12] For optimal freshness, it is recommended to store the harvested strawberries unwashed in the refrigerator for up to 3-5 days.[1, 12, 24] Washing should only be done immediately before consumption to prevent excess moisture from accelerating spoilage.[1, 24]

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this week-by-week growing schedule provides a comprehensive guide for cultivating hydroponic day-neutral strawberries, with specific considerations for a DWC system. By consistently monitoring and adjusting the nutrient solution, lighting, temperature, humidity, and VPD according to the recommendations outlined, and ensuring proper oxygenation and temperature control of the nutrient solution, growers can create an optimal environment for healthy plant growth and abundant fruit production. While this report offers a detailed framework, it is important to remember that continuous observation of the plants and adaptation of the schedule to the specific growing conditions and the plants' responses are key to achieving long-term success in hydroponic strawberry cultivation.
